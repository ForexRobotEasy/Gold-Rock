## Description

The Gold Rock Forex Robot is designed to trade gold in an automated manner. It utilizes various indicators and conditions to determine the entry and exit points for trades. The code is written in MQL5 programming language and can be used with compatible trading platforms.

## How it Works

The expert advisor (EA) follows a tick-based trading strategy. On each tick, it calculates the current price, previous price, market volatility, momentum, and trend. Based on these calculations, it determines the entry and exit conditions for trades.

The entry condition is met when there is sufficient volatility, positive momentum, and the current price is above the trend. If the entry condition is met, the EA calculates the lot size based on the account balance and risk level. It then opens a buy order with a stop loss and take profit levels.

The exit condition is met when the current price falls below the trend. In such cases, all open orders are closed.

The EA also includes helper functions to close all open orders and set stop loss for all open orders. These functions ensure proper risk management and order management.
